## Framework Upgrade

- Migrated from React 17 to **React 18.3.1**.
- Consolidated core layout components (`Navbar`, `Footer`, etc.) into a unified `MainFrame` directory for cleaner architecture.

## Page Redesign

- Rewrote the `PROJECTS` page. Introduced both **list** and **grid** views for more flexible content presentation, and restructured page hierarchy for better readability across devices.
- Added the `TRACKS` page for showing professional experience, built entirely from scratch.

## Mobile Optimization

- Added a context-aware, adaptive bottom navigation bar to improve accessibility on smaller screens.
- Audited and optimized layout depth and spacing for mobile, ensuring each page adapts fluidly to different screen sizes.

## Visual Enhancements

- Unified border-radius across buttons, cards, modals, and containers, and incorporated glassmorphic components for a modern interface.
- Integrated a light `Particle.js` effect on the homepage to enrich visual depth without distraction.
- Added entrance and exit animations to major pages for a more fluid and polished browsing experience.
- Enhanced user interaction by adding hover, tap, and motion-based animations across navigational links, buttons, and project items.
