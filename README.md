## Modifications

### üöÄ Framework & Core Upgrade

- **Upgraded to React 19**: Migrated from React 17 to **React 19.1.0**, replacing the legacy rendering method with the modern `createRoot` API for improved performance and future compatibility.
- **Component Structure Refactoring**: Consolidated core layout components (`Navbar`, `Footer`, etc.) into a unified `MainFrame` directory for cleaner architecture and easier maintenance.

### üß± Page Redesign & New Sections

- **Projects Page Overhaul**: Completely rewrote the `Projects` page. Introduced both **list** and **grid** views for more flexible content presentation, and restructured page hierarchy for better readability across devices.
- **New "Experiences" Section**: Added a fully responsive timeline-based section to showcase professional experience, built entirely from scratch.

### üì± Mobile Optimization & Navigation

- **Bottom Navigation for Mobile**: Added a context-aware, adaptive bottom navigation bar to improve accessibility on smaller screens.
- **Responsive Layout Refinement**: Audited and optimized layout depth and spacing for mobile, ensuring each page adapts fluidly to different screen sizes.

### ‚ú® UI & Visual Enhancements

- **Rounded UI Elements**: Applied consistent border-radius styling across buttons, cards, modals, and containers to create a smoother, modernized appearance.
- **Subtle Background Effects**: Integrated a light `Particle.js` effect on the homepage to enrich visual depth without distraction.
- **Page Transition Animations**: Added entrance and exit animations to major pages for a more fluid and polished browsing experience.
- **Component Interaction Feedback**: Enhanced user interaction by adding hover, tap, and motion-based animations across navigational links, buttons, and project items.
